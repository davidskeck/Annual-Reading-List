* [Wild - Cheryl Strayed](http://www.cherylstrayed.com/wild_108676.htm)

> To believe that I didn’t need to reach with my bare hands anymore. To know that seeing the fish beneath the surface of the water was enough. That it was everything. It was my life--like all lives, mysterious and irrevocable and sacred. So very close, so very present, so very belonging to me. How wild it was, to let it be.

* [The Obstacle is the Way - Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/welcome-to-the-obstacle-is-the-way-the-timeless-art-of-turning-trials-into-triumph/)

* [Anything You Want - Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/a)

* [The Art of Non-Conformity - Chris Guillebeau](http://chrisguillebeau.com/books/)

- [x] [Four Things Procrastinators Need to Learn - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2018/04/four-things-procrastinators-need-to-learn/)

>Finish something every time you sit down to work. Get to the end of a chapter, a section, a definite stage of some sort.

> If you can’t answer the question “What are you trying to finish right now?” then you’re probably making the task bigger, rather than moving towards its end.

* [The Cook and the Chef: Musk’s Secret Sauce - Tim Urban](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html)

> The challenge with this last epiphany is to somehow figure out a way to lose respect for your own fear. That respect is in our wiring, and the only way to weaken it is by defying it and seeing, when nothing bad ends up happening, that most of the fear you’ve been feeling has just been a smoke and mirrors act. Doing something out of your comfort zone and having it turn out okay is an incredibly powerful experience, one that changes you—and each time you have that kind of experience, it chips away at your respect for your brain’s ingrained, irrational fears.

* [Productivity - Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity)

> It doesn’t matter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction.  Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.  So think about it more!  Independent thought is hard but it’s something you can get better at with practice.  

> The most impressive people I know have strong beliefs about the world, which is rare in the general population.  If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever you last spoke with, that’s bad.  You will of course be wrong sometimes, but develop the confidence to stick with your convictions.  It will let you be courageous when you’re right about something important that most people don’t see.

* [The frightening thing you learn when you quit the 9 to 5 - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2014/04/quitting-the-9-to-5/)

> "I’m convinced now that nobody gets away with settling on work they don’t care about. The nagging banality of having to do irrelevant work five-sevenths of your days is not something that will eventually leave you alone. Nobody ever makes peace with with the ringing of their alarm clock. We either make a calculated escape, or resign to becoming cynical, bored — and worst — dependent on constant entertainment for relief, because our work does little but drain us."

* [Masters of love - Emily Esfahani Smith](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/)

> "Throughout the day, partners would make requests for connection, what Gottman calls “bids.” For example, say that the husband is a bird enthusiast and notices a goldfinch fly across the yard. He might say to his wife, “Look at that beautiful bird outside!” He’s not just commenting on the bird here: he’s requesting a response from his wife—a sign of interest or support—hoping they’ll connect, however momentarily, over the bird."

> "The wife now has a choice. She can respond by either “turning toward” or “turning away” from her husband, as Gottman puts it. Though the bird-bid might seem minor and silly, it can actually reveal a lot about the health of the relationship. The husband thought the bird was important enough to bring it up in conversation and the question is whether his wife recognizes and respects that."

* [10 Reasons You Should Never Get a Job - Steve Pavlina](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/07/10-reasons-you-should-never-get-a-job/)

> "The alternative is to remain happily jobless for life and to generate income through other means.  Realize that you earn income by providing value — not time — so find a way to provide your best value to others, and charge a fair price for it.  One of the simplest and most accessible ways is to start your own business.  Whatever work you’d otherwise do via employment, find a way to provide that same value directly to those who will benefit most from it.  It takes a bit more time to get going, but your freedom is easily worth the initial investment of time and energy."

 * [Your lifestyle has already been designed - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/)

> "But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work."

* [Showdown at the airport body scanner - Nathaniel Rich](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/showdown-at-the-airport-body-scanner/)

> "I am offered the option of enduring my rubdown in private. I always refuse: Civil disobedience is worth nothing if it’s not done in public."
...
> "Airplane travel is disquieting, as is dealing with peevish federal officers, as is life. Even the slightest gesture of assertiveness can create the pleasing illusion that you control your fate."

* [I do not fear death - Roger Ebert](http://www.salon.com/2011/09/15/roger_ebert/)

> "'Kindness' covers all of my political beliefs. No need to spell them out. I believe that if, at the end, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn’t always know this and am happy I lived long enough to find it out."

> "... if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

> "Everybody who does interesting, creative work, went through a phase where they had really good taste but they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be."
