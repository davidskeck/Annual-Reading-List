Annual Reading List
===================

This is a list of books and articles to read every year. There will be up to 10 items on this list at a time. Titles will be switched out as they become stale to me. Previously listed works are [archived](/archive.md).

- [x] = has been read this year.

Books
=====

##### 1.
- [ ] [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck - Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/books/subtle-art)

> You too are going to die, and that's because you too were fortunate enough to have lived. You may not feel this, but go stand on a cliff sometime, and maybe you will.

##### 2.
- [ ] [Wild - Cheryl Strayed](http://www.cherylstrayed.com/wild_108676.htm)

> To believe that I didn’t need to reach with my bare hands anymore. To know that seeing the fish beneath the surface of the water was enough. That it was everything. It was my life—like all lives, mysterious and irrevocable and sacred. So very close, so very present, so very belonging to me. How wild it was, to let it be.

##### 3.
- [ ] [A Guide to the Good Life - William Irvine](http://ecbiz147.inmotionhosting.com/~n1stce12/williambirvine.com/Guide.html)

> The joy the Stoics were interested in can best be described as a kind of objectless enjoyment—an enjoyment not of any particular thing but of all this. It is a delight in simply being able to participate in life. It is a profound realization that even though all this didn’t have to be possible, it is possible—wonderfully, magnificently possible.

Articles
========

##### 4.
- [x] [How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) - Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com)

> It seems like facing death makes all of those voices in your head who aren’t actually you melt away, leaving your little authentic self standing there all alone, in reflection. I think end-of-life regrets may simply be your authentic self thinking about the parts of your life you never got to live—the parts of you that someone else kicked down into your subconscious.

##### 5.
- [x] [Four Things Procrastinators Need to Learn - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2018/04/four-things-procrastinators-need-to-learn/)

>Finish something every time you sit down to work. Get to the end of a chapter, a section, a definite stage of some sort.

> If you can’t answer the question “What are you trying to finish right now?” then you’re probably making the task bigger, rather than moving towards its end.

##### 6.
- [x] [Money and Confidence are Interchangeable - Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/03/09/money-and-confidence-are-interchangeable/)

> You don’t have to OVERACHIEVE at everything you do – you can be strategically great at things you truly enjoy, carve the rest of the unnecessary crap out of your life, and spend your days in a much healthier balance of work and play.

##### 7.
- [x] [If It’s Important, Learn It Repeatedly - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2018/01/if-its-important-learn-it-repeatedly/)

This is essentially the reason for this Annual Reading List to exist. This is why we come back to important ideas at least once a year.

> Bringing a truth to mind repeatedly gives it an enduring, three-dimensional existence in your head, by reaching you in every mood and every context, in every season, both at times when you’re enthusiastic about it, and when you’re tired of hearing it.

##### 8.
- [ ] [The Secret to Connecting With People - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2009/04/the-secret-to-connecting-with-people/)

> The habit of really listening to what someone is saying is a rare one.  And the people who do it can connect with anyone.  I’ve understood the value of being a good listener for a long time, but I didn’t really know what it meant to be one.  I know now: it means to cherish other people’s desire to express themselves more than your own desire to express yourself. Really, just completely defer your interests for as long as it takes for you to understand them.

##### 9.
- [x] [You Are Free, Like it or Not - David Cain](http://www.raptitude.com/2015/06/you-are-free-like-it-or-not/)

> Sartre believed that we have much more freedom than we tend to acknowledge. We habitually deny it to protect ourselves from the horror of accepting full responsibility for our lives. In every instant, we are free to behave however we like, but we often act as though circumstances have reduced our options down to one or two ways to move forward.  

> If we acknowledged all of our options, the obvious thing to do might be something intimidating. Once you’ve acknowledged that it isn’t actually impossible for you to quit smoking, then you have to quit smoking. When freedom is scary, we pretend it isn’t there.

Other
=====
##### 10.
- [ ] [The Summer Day - Mary Oliver](http://www.loc.gov/poetry/180/133.html)

> I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down  
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,  
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,  
which is what I have been doing all day.  
Tell me, what else should I have done?

Why?
====

> As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives. - Henry David Thoreau

I feel like a lot of people read important ideas once and never get the chance to implement them. The purpose of this list is that ideas that are important to me get the chance to take hold in my mind. By reading these works annually, I will be introduced to these ideas again and again until they become habitual to me.
